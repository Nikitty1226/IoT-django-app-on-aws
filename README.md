## 📌 Overview

- ✅ Door status (open/close) collected via **Raspberry Pi GPIO**
- ✅ Sent via MQTT to AWS Lambda
- ✅ Stored in PostgreSQL and visualized through Django Admin UI
- ✅ Deployable using **AWS SAM**

---

## 📷 Use Case: "Home Monitoring System"

- Detect door open/close state with a magnetic sensor
- Send state changes to a Django backend via Lambda
- Monitor logs from anywhere

## ⚙️ Architecture

```text
[Door Sensor] → [Raspberry Pi] → [MQTT] → [Lambda (Django)]
                                                      ↓
                                               [RDS: PostgreSQL]

```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Dev)
```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/IoT-django-app-on-aws.git
docker-compose up
```
Then open:
http://localhost:8000/admin

## ☁️ Deploying to AWS
```
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided
```
> You'll need:  
> - A valid KeyPair name  
> - An S3 bucket (or use a managed one)  
> - AWS credentials configured (`aws configure`)
